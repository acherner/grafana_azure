You need 3 subnets in this setup because each plays a **different role** in making your Grafana + Postgres + Private Networking work reliably inside Azure. Azure enforces separation of concerns for certain PaaS features.

---

## 🔹 1. **App Service Integration Subnet (`s_appint`)**

* Purpose: gives **Grafana App Service** outbound access **into your VNet**.
* Without this, Grafana (which is multi-tenant PaaS) would only have a public egress path.
* With VNet Integration, Grafana can:

  * Reach your **Postgres Flexible Server** (in private subnet).
  * Reach **Azure Monitor/Logs via AMPLS private endpoints**.
  * Be inspected by your hub firewall/NVA if you enforce UDRs.
* Limitation: you can’t host anything else in this subnet (only App Service integration tunnel).

---

## 🔹 2. **Private Endpoint Subnet (`s_pe`)**

* Purpose: hosts **Private Endpoint NICs** for Grafana UI and AMPLS.
* Each Private Endpoint = a NIC Azure injects into your VNet with a **private IP**.
* Clients (your NOC laptops via VPN or peering) resolve `*.privatelink.azurewebsites.net` → this subnet’s private IP.
* Azure requires PE subnets to have **network policies disabled** so you don’t break Azure’s control of those NICs.
* Nothing else should be placed here besides PEs.

---

## 🔹 3. **Postgres Delegated Subnet (`s_pg`)**

* Purpose: reserved for **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** when using **private access**.
* Azure deploys the database’s underlying NICs here.
* It must be **delegated** to `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers`, otherwise Flexible Server won’t deploy.
* This makes the DB accessible on a private IP, not public.
* Nothing else can go in this subnet — it’s exclusive to the managed Postgres service.

---

## ✅ Why three instead of one?

Because Azure has **different technical requirements**:

* App Service Integration can’t share a subnet with PEs or delegated services.
* Private Endpoints require network policies off, but Postgres needs delegation and normal policies.
* Postgres needs its own delegated subnet; Azure won’t let you mix it with other resources.

So it’s not “over-engineering” — it’s required by Azure’s design to keep PaaS networking predictable and secure.

👉 Want me to draw you a **simplified diagram with just the three subnets** and their exact purposes (UI ingress, App Service egress, DB private hosting), so it’s super clear how traffic flows between them?
